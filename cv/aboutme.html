            <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
            <p id='growing_up'>
              I honestly can’t say I always dreamt of going into Mathematics and Computer Science. Growing up I was sure college wasn’t in the cards for me, so I never bothered with dreaming about what I would do with a college degree. When I was younger, I was slated to take over the family business in flooring. My father built this business from the ground up with no high school education, let alone college, and some of my favorite childhood memories are spent working alongside him carpeting a hotel or a mansion. “Work as best as you can with your god-given ability”, he would say, “financial recompense is merely a by-product”. These words resonated with me as I witnessed his business continuously grow. Sadly, working that much severely taxed our family. Just as I was starting High School, this burden finally took its toll and my parents divorced. My father was devastated. On top of losing our family, we lost our home, the business, and most importantly I lost the father I admired so much to his vices. His ‘coping’ mechanisms spent any money we had left, so it would have been impossible to put me through college. So, since I never bothered to dream about what a college life would be, I decided to start working.

            <h4 id="restaurant">Restaurant Career</h4>

            <p>
              Regardless of his business’ eventual collapse, my father’s business sense continued to drive my attitude towards my own career. By working as hard as I could, simply because I could, I was quickly promoted to management in my first job at a local restaurant. As a manager, we were responsible for analyzing the food cost, liquor cost, profit and loss reports, and employee sales, but our primary responsibilities were, first and foremost, about taking care of the guests. To minimize the amount of time we had to spend on these office tasks, I developed excel spreadsheets that automatically generated the liquor and food costs from the inventory reports, our quarterly numbers from the profit and loss reports, and track the employee’s sales quotas from their daily checkout. Although I had no programming experience, I quickly developed a knack for excel mostly through trial and error. For 6 years, I continued to build my career by moving to a new restaurant once I felt I learned everything I could at my current restaurant, and at each new location I would also take the time to automate their data analysis procedures. However, I realized this had become my favorite part of the job. Thus, after building a respectable career at my dream restaurant, I took a huge risk to leave it all behind to try and be the first in my family to get a college degree.

            <p id="starting_school">
              I didn’t know what Computer Science was when I started school, so I began taking all the courses necessary for a Mathematics, Physics, or Engineering degree. Following my same attitude towards work, I maintained a 3.96 GPA throughout community college. Mimicking my success with the restaurant sales reports, I would analyze the datasets generated by my Physics and Engineering experiments, and I would simulate the theories of my Math classes with the Maple Computer Algebra System. However, I then discovered how intricate the data analytics and automation tools I would develop truly could be. Furthermore, I learned that I could study these complexities in the field of Computer Science. So I began to take Computer Science courses, and the more I discovered the more I yearned for it. It became official at UC Davis when I decided to double major in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics, and I’ve never looked back.

              Once I started at UC Davis, my studies of Computer Science became far more in depth. After taking a couple upper division courses, I started to become interested in Machine Learning. Its proximity to artificial intelligence makes it interesting, but its rigorous computational foundation has truly allowed me to use my skills in Mathematics and Computer Science in tandem. I specifically became interested in Data Science; where I could agglomerate my interests in Probability, Statistics, Machine Learning, and algorithm design. Once I had taken a few courses in Probability and Machine Learning I wanted to see where the field was going and began to purse a research opportunity.
            </p>  
            <p id="research">
              My first undergraduate researcher position was studying Optimal Experimental Design at the UC Davis Genome Center. There I could use all the interest I had developed in the subject of Machine Learning and apply it to actual applications. I implemented a Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR) model in Matlab that had incremental learning capabilities. Since the LWPR model had many hyper parameters from the separate distance metric and kernel, properly tuning these parameters was an important part of developing this model. One tuned, I then studied the effects of Optimal Experimental Design via uncertainty queries across the feature space to selectively choose which samples to incrementally train the model with. This experience taught me firsthand the drastic difference between studying a topic in a classroom and independently studying a subject in a research setting. This experience was enough to provide me a foundation to obtain a job as the Data Analyst and Scientific Programmer for Forage Genetics International, the world leader in value added alfalfa genetics.

            <p>
              Forage Genetics was “above my pay grade” to say the least. I was tasked with developing analytical tools for automatically computing the lab’s raw data. Using the R programming language, I developed a package that uses semi-supervised models to predict the number of copies of a given gene given only around 10% labeled Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) data. To combat the significant batch effects and varied trends between the jobs, I developed a mixed model approach combining Multinomial Logistic Regression, a Gaussian mixture model algorithm, and a semi-supervised K-means algorithm. By combining these models into a single package, I averaged between 94 and 97 percent accuracy in dosages called against a reference housekeeping gene. Then I used the Linux Chron scheduler to automatically run this package as new data is added to the server. Upon the success of this model, I was invited to remain with Forage Genetics permanently, hire a team, and build an API to automate the other lab processes. My team and I have begun automating dosage calling on bi-allelic markers as well as presence absence detection on any of the 7 different assays sent to our lab, and we are preparing to perform a genome-wide study on the parental genotypes for next year’s haplotyping. To prepare for the Genomics we perform in the lab, I attended a Genome Sequencing workshop led by the Bioinformatics Core at UC Davis. I received more than just an education from this workshop; I was also offered a research position.

            <p id="biocore">
              After the workshop, I started working with the UC Davis Bioinformatics core working on a novel alignment algorithm for Microbial Community Analysis. This project consists of developing a single reference genome from which we can align any 16S microbial genome to construct a position dependent feature set from .BAM file CIGAR strings. I implemented the alignment and extraction algorithms in Python and have begun designing a Convolution Neural Network to take advantage of the sparsity of the feature set. Once the model is complete, we hope to combat the unnecessary assumptions required of other models and accurately predict the presence of microbes simply from their genome. This project continues to push my ability in model development as well as Genomics research.

            These types of tasks are why I got into computer science. Fully automating complex task by generalizing their intricacies into its most basic components, and then constructing a general framework out of those components. Studying both Mathematics and Computer Science has given me a unique advantage in achieving these goals by building the fundamentals required to deconstruct these tasks. I want to study every aspect of Data Science in detail; Machine Learning, Statistics, Optimization, Probability, Algorithms, and more. I don’t just want to learn how to use pre-made models in some pre-existing API. I want to study every aspect of Data Science in detail; to understand the assumptions behind these models, the Mathematics that ensures these models work, the Statistical notions that justify their effectiveness, and the Computer Science concepts in scaling these models for meaningful datasets.
