In statistics, Wold's decomposition or the Wold representation theorem (not to be confused with the Wold theorem that is the discrete-time analog of the Wiener-Khinchin theorem) named after Herman Wold, says that every covariance-stationary time series $Y_t$ can be written as the sum of two time series, one deterministic and one stochastic.\\
Formally
$$Y_t = \sum_{j=0}^\infty b_j\epsilon_{t-j}+\nu_t$$
where:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[*] $Y_t$ is the time series being considered,
\item[*] $\epsilon$ is an uncorrelated sequence which is the innovation process to the process $Y_t$- that is, a white noise process that is input to the linear filter $\{b_j\}$.
\item[*] $b$ is the \textit{possibly} infinite vector of moving average weights (coefficients or paramaters)
\item[*] $\nu_t$ is a deterministic time series, such as one represented by a sine wave.
